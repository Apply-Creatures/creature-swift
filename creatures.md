### Repo/component

Each need a name, that's boring to call creature-denoiser, creature-api
Plus. what API? it then becomes creature-api-backend
What backend? it then becomes creature-api-backend-db
What DB? you get the gist


Instead, we pick a name. The topic for now is feathered creatures
Chose wisely, as they would become memorable for their task
